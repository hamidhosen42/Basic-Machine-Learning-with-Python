## [Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning](https://medium.com/@hamid42/difference-between-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-f51643aeb647):
   ### Supervised Learning:

   In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data that is well “labeled.” It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.
     
   A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning Data science models takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, Data scientist must rebuild models to make sure the insights given remains true until its data changes.
    
   ### Unsupervised Learning:

   Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning deep learning and reinforcement learning methods.

## R-Squared Value:
   R-squared is a goodness-of-fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively. R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 – 100% scale. Image of a large R-squared. After fitting a linear regression model, you need to determine how well the model fits the data. Does it do a good job of explaining changes in the dependent variable? There are several key goodness-of-fit statistics for regression analysis.
