## Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:
     
     In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data that is well “labeled.” It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.
     
A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning Data science models takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, Data scientist must rebuild models to make sure the insights given remains true until its data changes.
